staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000100=You're a new face - we don't get many of those around here!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000201=You must be ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000250=On behalf of all of us here in ^c:1486b0;Staxel^c:pop;, welcome!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000300=I'm ^c:1486b0;{0-name}^c:pop; by the way!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000400=I've been sent to make sure you know how to take care of the farm properly!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000500=That was you right? The one taking over the old farm?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000600=Yup, that's me
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000700=No...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000800=Nice to see you again!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10000900=Doing well?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001100=No? Hmm... are you sure about that?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001200=Oh well, I guess this must be a pleasant surprise then?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001300=Excellent! Just as I thought!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001350=Glad to hear it!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10001900=First, I'll take you on a brief tour of the village.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002000=Then we'll head over to the farm.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002100=Hopefully it'll quickly start to feel familiar!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002150=Oh, and if you manage to get lost, you can check your map anytime!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002200=Follow me!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002300=This is the local ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002400=It's a pretty nice place to hang out after a long day of work!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002500=^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop;, the owner, can be a good source of local rumours.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002600=You should head on in and talk to him - I think he has something for you!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002700=I'll be waiting right here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002800=Ready to move on?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10002900=Yes, lead the way!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003000=Not quite yet.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003100=Next up, let's head to the ^c:1486b0;supermarket^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003200=Follow me!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003300=The ^c:1486b0;supermarket^c:pop; sells many of the items you'll need on a daily basis.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003400=There's things like pet ^c:d03e37;food^c:pop;, ^c:d03e37;seeds^c:pop;, ^c:d03e37;tools^c:pop;, and other handy items!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003500=While you were busy chatting with ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; I popped over to the merchants.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003510=They're just on the other side of the ^c:1486b0;town square^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003520=They don't just sell wares, they'll buy things off you too!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003530=You just need to place the item on the sell spot and click it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003550=Those ^c:d03e37;seeds^c:pop; should come in handy I think!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003560=We'll need to head to the farm so that you can actually make use of them though!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003570=This might be a good time to memorise the path to and from the village!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10003600=It's this way!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10004600=So here it is - your new home!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10004700=It might be a bit daunting at first, but you'll settle in.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10004800=You're a little ways outside the village compared to the rest of us.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005000=Hopefully your pet should keep you from feeling too lonely once it arrives!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005100=If not, we're just down the road and always happy to chat.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005200=Perhaps we should start by heading out to the fields?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005300=Follow me!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005400=You can ^c:d03e37;hoe^c:pop; grass to create tilled soil to plant ^c:d03e37;seeds^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005500=If you ^c:d03e37;hold down the button^c:pop;, you can ^c:d03e37;charge^c:pop; to till a larger area!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005600=Give it a shot and plant the ^c:d03e37;seeds^c:pop; I gave you earlier.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005700=If you lost them, you can buy some more from one of the merchants!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005800=Have you planted any ^c:d03e37;seeds^c:pop; yet?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005900=I gave you some earlier, remember?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10005910=The merchants in the ^c:1486b0;square^c:pop; sell them otherwise!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006000=Good job!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006100=Here's a little something to celebrate your success!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006200=You can use the ^c:d03e37;watering can^c:pop; to water your crops.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006300=If you don't water them every day, they'll start to wither.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006400=Withered crops won't grow!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006500=Go on, give it a shot!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006600=Looks like you've got the hang of it!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006700=Here, another reward.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006710=Hmm...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006720=I think it's going to take quite a while for the crop to grow...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006730=In fact, I'm already starting to feel a bit thirsty!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006740=Could you take this note to ^c:1486b0;{0-bar_name}^c:pop; and bring me back something to drink?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006750=Might be good to see if he has any tasks for you while you're at it!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006760=I'll be waiting right here when you get back!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006782=Still not done helping ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; out?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006783=I'm getting thirstier by the minute!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006800=Those plants don't look very wet to me...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006810=Hm? So where's my ^c:d03e37;sap^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006815=You don't have it?!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006820=^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; assured you that this was all you needed?!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006823=Oh.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006825=By the way... is... is that ^c:d03e37;letter^c:pop; for me?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006826=Let me just take it off you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006827=...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006828=Well now... he didn't have to be so blunt about it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006830=Oh well. Nothing for it I guess...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006840=You're lucky I'm a kind-hearted person or I might have withheld your pet in retaliation!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006850=There you go!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006860=I suppose I should teach you how to properly place the ^c:d03e37;pet house^c:pop; too!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006862=A ^c:d03e37;hammer^c:pop; might be useful here just in case you place it incorrectly and want to adjust!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006864=You can place the ^c:d03e37;pet house^c:pop; in a similar way to using a tool.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006866=If you ^c:d03e37;hold down the button^c:pop;, you can ^c:d03e37;rotate^c:pop; to get it to face the way you want before placing!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006868=Go on, try it out!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006870=Ah! Good job!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006871=Are you sure you're happy with that rotation?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006872=Remember, if you change your mind, you can use the ^c:d03e37;hammer^c:pop; to break it!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006874=The pet will be safely stored until you place it again!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006875=If you ^c:d03e37;hold down the button while placing^c:pop;, you can ^c:d03e37;rotate^c:pop; it first!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006876=Well? What are you waiting for?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006878=Go ahead and place your ^c:d03e37;pet house^c:pop; so you can meet your new pet!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006880=^c:d03e37;Holding down the button^c:pop; during placement will let you ^c:d03e37;rotate^c:pop; it just right!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006900=Your pet is going to get hungry pretty quickly by the way.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006974=Hmm? Who might you be?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10006975=Hi ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;... Oh, you got my letter then?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007000=I think it might be a good idea to stock up on some ^c:d03e37;pet food^c:pop; when you can.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007074=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop; you say?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007075=I just finished helping ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; clear out the ^c:1486b0;Tavern^c:pop; stock room.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007076=While we were there, we found some old seed packets in the back.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007100=The ^c:1486b0;supermarket^c:pop; sells many of the things you need for everyday life.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007174=Let me see... doesn't look like you're on my list!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007175=^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; said I should give them to you, he’s a kind soul that way.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007200=I'd check there.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007274=I'm guessing you're a friend of the farm's new owner?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007275=That reminds me... You should introduce yourself to everyone!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007300=For now, you can place the ^c:d03e37;bowl^c:pop; you got earlier and fill that.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007374=Welcome to the village! I hope you enjoy your stay!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007375=How about you get started off by thanking ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; for these seeds?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007376=Come back when you’re done!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007377=Hey ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, have you talked to ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; yet?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007378=...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007382=Still here?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007386=Well I guess I could give you a small welcome package...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007388=Just don't go telling anyone about this...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007400=Let me know once it's done!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007475=He’s normally behind the bar in the ^c:1486b0;Tavern^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007500=Great! Now your pet should be good for a while!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007575=Do you need a refresher on befriending villagers?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007600=Hmm...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007650=You know what? I'm tired of waiting on that crop...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007675=Yeah, please!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007700=I want to see a ^c:d03e37;bowl^c:pop; filled to the brim with ^c:d03e37;pet food^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007775=No, I've got this.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007776=You're a master of charisma already, eh?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007800=The ^c:1486b0;supermarket^c:pop; should sell them.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007875=^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; needs my help again later?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007880=He really ought to get some staff to help him out...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007900=I imagine you're also getting a bit tired of looking at me by now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007975=Anyway... see how easy it is to make friends around here?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10007976=You should get started on introducing yourself to everyone else.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008075=Speaking of introducing yourself... from time to time new people will want to move in.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008100=You see that ^c:d03e37;jar of water^c:pop; I just gave you?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008175=You should check with ^c:1486b0;Mayor Max^c:pop; every now and again, to see if anyone needs help settling down.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008200=This is no standard tap water!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008275=I heard through the grapevine, that you built a great ^c:1486b0;Barn^c:pop;, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008300=^c:d03e37;Magic Water^c:pop; will grow any crop instantly! Cool huh?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008375=I bet this ^c:1486b0;Cow^c:pop; is just itching to stretch it’s legs...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008400=Some merchants might sell it so keep an eye out. It's pretty rare and expensive though!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008475=While I was waiting, I did get you some stuff in preparation...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008500=Pour it over that crop you just planted and get to harvesting!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008575=Make sure to keep that cow fed! It'll be a lot happier if you do so.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008576=Who am I kidding, I bet you’ll do a fine job taking care of it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008600=You did it! Not as hard as it sounds is it?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008675=Can you imagine turning a corner and just seeing a ^c:1486b0;Cow^c:pop; in the middle of the path?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008700=The time has finally come to give you your ^c:d03e37;Farm Registration Letter^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008775=That was a surprise for sure...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008800=You should head to the ^c:1486b0;town hall^c:pop; to file it with ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; as soon as possible.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008875=You should go see ^c:1486b0;Aliza^c:pop;, she can help you build a ^c:1486b0;Barn^c:pop; for it..
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008900=In exchange you'll get a special package to help jump start your farm!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10008975=Hey ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, I see you got your ^c:d03e37;Farm License^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009000=As for me, I think it's about time I get out of your way.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009075=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; told me the news yesterday! I'm really happy for you!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009100=You can always look me up in town!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009175=He also gave me this little hooligan, and told me to give it to you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009200=Good luck!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009275=It just kept pecking at my glasses... It wouldn't stop.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009300=It doesn't look like you've harvested the crop yet.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009375=I don't think it likes me much... and the feeling is mutual.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009400=Pour ^c:d03e37;Magic Water^c:pop; on crop. Pick crop. Easy!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009475=Anyway, I wanted to pitch in too, so I got these for you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009476=You'll need to set up an area for the little... rascal.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009477=Here's a ^c:d03e37;Chicken Coop Marker^c:pop; to get you started.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009478=You can buy the rest of the requirements for it at the store, this should help towards it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009479=You'll need to set that up before you can buy any more chickens.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009500=Hi ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009575=Well, I should let you get back to farming. I hope you have a great day, official farmer ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009576=Hey there, you're ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop; right?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009577=Welcome to Staxel! I'm ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009600=It looks like you've achieved some interesting new feats!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009675=^c:1486b0;Mayor Max^c:pop; told me you're moving in to help out on the local farm.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009700=These are from the town to commemorate the occasion!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009775=Although I didn’t know when to expect you...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009800=Don't forget to visit me again next time!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009875=You know, I organised a bit of a welcome pack for you, but I haven't had time to pick it up yet.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009900=So are you ready to learn a bit about farming?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10009975=Do you think you could go pick it up from the ^c:1486b0;General Store^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010000=I can show you around the village and evaluate your skills.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010075=Wow thanks, sure!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010100=We need to make sure you know what you're doing!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010175=Alright...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010200=Then we can give you a ^c:d03e37;farming license^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010275=Great! ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; should have it. All you need to do is check your ^c:1486b0;Map^c:pop; and you should find him.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010300=Sound good?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010375=I'll be waiting at the farm if you need me.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010475=I see you got the welcome package. Though you kept me waiting...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010575=We better get some of those seeds planted.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010600=Oh... you don't think you need the help?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010675=It's super easy and you already have all the tools you need!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010700=Not interested in the subtleties of farming?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010775=Let me know when you've planted and watered those seeds.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010800=Are you absolutely sure?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010875=I'll be waiting around in the village this time.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10010900=Positive.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011000=Actually...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011100=Oh.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011200=Well if that's how you want to play it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011300=Don't expect any help with your farm then!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011400=Without your ^c:d03e37;license^c:pop; you won't be able to fully restore it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011500=I doubt the mayor will support you either.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011600=We had a nice little companion to give you too...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011700=Oh well. Your loss.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011800=Come grovel if you ever change your mind.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10011900=Oh. You again.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012000=Have you realised your mistake?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012100=Come back to beg for your ^c:d03e37;license^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012200=If you've changed your mind I might just forgive you...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012300=I've changed my mind.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012400=Nope, not interested.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012500=Then what are you here for?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012600=Come back when you're ready to grovel!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012800=Oh, really? That's encouraging!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10012900=You'll need a ^w:i;local^w:clear; license, but I see you already have your ^c:d03e37;Farm Registration Letter^c:pop; prepared for that!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013000=Don't forget to run it over to ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; at the ^c:1486b0;town hall^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013100=There's still a barn waiting to be built!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013200=Oh, right, I have a pet for you too! Which one did you want?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013300=I'll take the cat!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013400=I'll take the dog!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013500=There you go! Good luck with the farm!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013600=^c:1486b0;Butterflies^c:pop;? I'm really more into the farming side of things...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013700=But I guess I've seen ^c:1486b0;blue butterflies^c:pop;, ^c:1486b0;pink butterflies^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013800=^c:1486b0;Purple butterflies^c:pop;, ^c:1486b0;white butterflies^c:pop;...oh, ^c:1486b0;yellow butterflies^c:pop; too.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10013900=Does that answer your question?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014000=^c:1486b0;Rowan's^c:pop; looking for a part-time helper, is he?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014100=Do you think he'd let me drink as much ^c:d03e37;sap^c:pop; as I want on the job?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014200=Tell him I'm on board if he will!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014300=Oh, I remember this. I think I gave ^c:1486b0;Oscar^c:pop; this ^c:d03e37;broom^c:pop; for one of his birthdays...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014400=I see he's managed to make you into his lackey!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014500=I was hoping to do that first...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014600=Here to participate in the harvest festival? Let me just give you a quick rundown of the rules!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014700=This is a produce-growing competition! Bring in the best of your crops and win a prize!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014800=If you're lucky, you might find yourself the grand prize winner!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10014900=How nice! You win a {0-reward}!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015000=I've seen better...but it's not a bad specimen. Here's a {0-reward} for your efforts!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015100=Hey, so want me to let you in on a little secret?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015200=I've been so excited about this amazing new crop I discovered, but I haven't been able to get away...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015300=I wanted to take part in the contest, not handle it!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015400=But maybe you can do it for me instead? I just want to see the crop win!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015500=If you plant these ^c:1486b0;seeds^c:pop;, I guarantee you'll get a crop that no one can beat!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015600=You'll never have seen anything like it before!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015700=Wow! Now that is one massive ^c:1486b0;turnip^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015800=I don't think I've ever seen anything this impressive before in my life!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10015900=Whoever came up with this crop must have been a true genius, I'm sure!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016000=That ^c:1486b0;voucher^c:pop; entitles you to the grand prize. No one is going to beat that!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016100=Take it over to ^c:1486b0;{0-max}^c:pop;—he wanted to keep an eye on that one himself!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016200=Hey there, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016300=How's it going down at the farm? Pretty good I hope?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016400=You moving in there has been a little bit of a problem for me after all...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016500=Oh, not that I mean to accuse you or anything...I was technically just squatting after all.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016600=But it does mean I don't really have anywhere to live right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016700=The ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop; is okay, but it does get a bit crowded with ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; around at night.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016800=And I get the feeling ^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; doesn't likely leaving me unattended in his establishment...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10016900=So what do you say? Feeling up to building me a house?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017000=This ^c:d03e37;mailbox^c:pop; will designate the house as being mine once it's complete!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017100=I hope I can count on you!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017200=Still working on my house I hope?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017300=Alternatively I can just move back in at your place? No?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017400=Nice, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Very nice!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017500=Now I won't have to sleep in the ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop; with one eye open any more!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017600=This is just a little reward to congratulate you on a job well done.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017700=Thanks for all your help!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017800=Hey, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, how's the farm?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10017900=I'm still trying to get properly settled in to my new home.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018000=It's just...I think I'm too used to sleeping with all the farm memorabilia around...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018100=It's surprisingly hard to fall asleep without them!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018200=Maybe you could help me by tracking down some old bits and pieces around the island?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018300=Just a few things that are very collectable, you know?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018400=I'd settle for a ^c:d03e37;star jelly^c:pop;, a ^c:d03e37;fossilised slime^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;paw shell^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018500=Do you think you can manage that?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018600=Nice! This is a really good start!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018700=I hope you're all warmed up now because the next ones are going to be a bit tougher!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018800=A long time ago, there was an ^c:d03e37;old tractor^c:pop; that got stuck in a ditch somewhere around here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10018900=I think if you went mining a few ^c:d03e37;fossil rocks^c:pop; you might be able to come across some parts of it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019000=I think a ^c:d03e37;star jelly^c:pop;, a ^c:d03e37;fossilised slime^c:pop;, and a ^c:d03e37;paw shell^c:pop; would help me feel a bit more at home.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019100=Think you can get all of those?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019200=Oooh, yes! This is a wonderful piece of memorabilia!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019300=While you were out digging that up, I remembered something else.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019400=There were some ^c:d03e37;old tools^c:pop; the previous owner used to use a lot.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019500=I think he lost some of them in one of the ^c:1486b0;lakes^c:pop;. Maybe you could fish them up?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019600=Any luck find parts of that ^c:d03e37;old tractor^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019700=I imagine you might be able to dig them up by mining a few ^c:d03e37;fossil rocks^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019800=Yes, these are the ones I remember!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10019900=A bit rusty maybe, but they're definitely very collectable!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020000=Now, there's just one last thing... It might be the most important thing too...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020100=There's a limited-time online auction running for some really rare pieces of memorabilia...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020200=Items that belonged to legendary farmers who changed the world!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020300=The trouble is...they're a bit expensive...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020400=Do you think you could put together ^c:d03e37;{0-currency}10,000,000^c:pop; over the next two days?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020500=I understand if you can't, but still...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020600=Did you manage to fish up any of the ^c:d03e37;old tools^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020700=I know they fell into one of the ^c:1486b0;lakes^c:pop; around here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020800=There's still time left, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10020900=You can still gather the money!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021000=Well...it looks like we couldn't raise the money in time...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021100=But...that's okay I suppose. I heard ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; was the one who actually won it...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021200=So perhaps we could still try reasoning with him?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021300=He wouldn't say anything about it?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021400=Oh well...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021500=I suppose I'll keep looking for other things...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021600=Thanks for helping me out so far though!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021700=Hi, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021800=I think ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; said he wanted to see you whenever you're free...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10021900=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; told me to send you over if you came on by.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022000=Hmm? ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? My birthday?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022100=Oh...I suppose that is coming up, isn't it?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022200=You want to give everything to me now? Well I'm not about to say no!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022300=Oh! I've been searching for a copy of this book for years! Where did you find it?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022400=Oh oh! And is this that item ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; won on auction? He bought it for me?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022500=You baked the ^c:d03e37;cake^c:pop;, you say? I'm sure it will be delicious!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022600=Although...it looks like you didn't quite know what name to put on the cake...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022700=Thank you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! People don't usually want to celebrate my birthday...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022800=Could you pass on my thanks to ^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; as well?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10022900=I think I want to keep admiring my presents...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023000=Hi, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023100=I've been keeping an eye on your progress and it looks like you've really settled in.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023200=This is a wonderful island, right? Do you think you're ready for the ultimate test?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023300=At some point, everyone has to go through this to prove just how much they know about the island!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023400=Before you arrived, I hid ^c:d03e37;13 bobbleheads^c:pop; around the village!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023500=If you can find them all and show them to me, I'll acknowledge that you know the village like the back of your hand.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023600=It doesn't matter what order you bring them in, just head out and find them!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023700=He talked a lot about landscape and terrain, especially beaches.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023800=Maybe he was a painter?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10023900=I'd love to get her to design me a furniture set someday!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024000=Custom made is always the best!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024100=Before I met this one, I was a little less sarcastic...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024200=I wonder what that means?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024300=I see him running around everywhere!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024400=I think he puts out newsletters and things like that a lot too.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024500=He's an artist! I think everyone in the village likes wearing his branded clothes.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024600=If memory serves, he makes lots of really cool music!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024700=Maybe we can get him to come play a live concert or something?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024800=He's the one who makes everything around here work. Literally everything.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10024900=He works a lot with sounds. They really make games come alive!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025000=He claims to exist only when you're not looking...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025100=But I'm absolutely sure I've seen him around a few times...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025200=Hmm...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025300=Something about this ^c:d03e37;bobblehead^c:pop; seems missing...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025400=I heard he invented the ^c:d03e37;sprinkler^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025500=We could definitely use more of those around here!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025600=He's the architect who built all the houses in the village!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025700=Nothing has fallen down yet!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025800=He does a lot of work in marketing!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10025900=Maybe he could help getting more visitors interested in our festivals?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026000=Oh, you found another ^c:d03e37;bobblehead^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026100=Let me see!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026200=Ahh, I remember this one...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026300=So I think that just leaves ^c:d03e37;{0-remainingBobbleheads} bobbleheads^c:pop; to go!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026400=Oh, I think that's all of them!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026500=Wow. I didn't think you'd actually manage to find them all!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026600=Even I forgot where I put most of them...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026700=I suppose that means you're the one who knows this village the best!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026800=You've definitely come a long way since you first got here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10026900=I still remember the day you arrived...showing you the ropes.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027000=Who knew you'd surpass me this quickly?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027100=I still remember the day you arrived...when you told me you were already a licensed farmer.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027200=It was exciting to have another expert around!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027300=If you're ever lonely on that farm, just know that I'd still love to live there!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:10027400=You can ask me any time!

staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010010=Welcome to Staxel! I'm ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010020=^c:1486b0;Mayor Max^c:pop; told me you're moving in to take over this old farm.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010030=It's fallen into a bit of disrepair, but I can't wait to see what you do with the place!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010040=You know, I prepared a bit of a welcome pack for you, but in all the excitement I left it at the store...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010050=Do you think you could go pick it up from the ^c:1486b0;General Store^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010060=Wow thanks, sure!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010070=Alright...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010080=Great! ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; should have it. All you need to do is check your ^c:1486b0;Map^c:pop; and you should find him.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010090=You can find ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop;'s store in town. It’s the big blue building near the town center.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010100=Don't forget... you can check your ^c:1486b0;Map^c:pop; if you're lost. You remember how to use it, right?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010110=Nope...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010120=Sure do!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010130=Welcome back ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, I see you got the welcome package!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010140=We better get some of those seeds planted before it's too late in the day. What do you say?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010150=Sure!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010160=I don't know how...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010170=It's super easy and you already have all the tools you need!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010180=Let me know when you've planted and watered those seeds.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010190=You might have seen them on your way to ^c:1486b0;Leif's^c:pop; store earlier...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010200=The ^c:1486b0;Murmur Merchants^c:pop; in town will buy anything you're selling.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010210=Use your map to find them and go sell them this ^c:d03e37;Turnip^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010211=I'm going to the ^c:1486b0;town square^c:pop; now...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010220=When you're done selling that ^c:d03e37;Turnip^c:pop;, come find me!

staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010222=Well... be sure to sell that turnip when you get a chance ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010223=Anything you find, catch, grow or make, you can sell to the merchants for a pretty petal.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010230=Nice one, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Anything you find, catch, grow or make, you can sell to the merchants for a pretty petal.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010240=I think that’s everything I had planned to teach you today...

staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010251=Just one more thing though, I got this ^c:d03e37;Postbox^c:pop; for you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010252=Be sure to place it down so that the others can contact you.

staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010260=Just one more thing though, keep an eye on that ^c:d03e37;Postbox^c:pop; beside your front door...
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010261=You may find letters from myself and some of the other villagers in it sometimes.

staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010380=On that note...I found this ^c:d03e37;Turnip^c:pop; growing out back, why don't you go sell it for me?
staxel.village.dialogue.Tutorial.line:100010390=Where do I sell it?
