staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000100=People always ask me to do things for them...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000200=I never turn them down.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000300=Sometimes it's hard to get everything done on time...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000400=I wish ^c:1486b0;{0-tomboy_name}^c:pop; would be a bit less rowdy...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000500=She makes such a racket whenever she's about the town.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000600=It's a bit intimidating.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000700=It's so nice not to have any rowdy people in town!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000800=I can lie in the grass and read a book without being disturbed.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10000900=If I say I'll do something, nothing will stop me from getting it done.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001000=There are few things worse than being unreliable.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001100=I'd love to go out and see more of the world.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001200=I don't really have the time for it though.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001300=Even if I did, I'm not sure I'd be able to brave it alone!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001400=It might not seem like it at first, but I actually really enjoy a good chat.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001500=I think most of us here in the village do!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001600=Get to know people a bit better and I'm sure they'll start to open up to you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001700=It can be pretty hard to be spontaneous with people you've only just met.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001800=I prefer to think carefully about what I want to say.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10001900=Plan ahead so that I don't say anything stupid, you know?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002000=Just the other day I was strolling through the forest...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002100=I like spending some time in the nature sometimes, see...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002200=But then there was this terrifying moaning.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002300=I haven't been able to work up the courage to go back since...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002400=Hmm, you want to know a bit more about the island's ^c:1486b0;butterflies^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002500=Well I suppose there are a fair number of varieties. You've most likely seen the common ones already.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002600=Amongst the rare we have ^c:1486b0;monarch butterflies^c:pop; and ^c:1486b0;zebra butterflies^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002700=I think there were ^c:1486b0;emperor butterflies^c:pop; around here too.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002800=There could be more, but I think those are the important ones.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10002900=...^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003000=How can I help you today?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003100=A ^c:d03e37;gift^c:pop; for me? From ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003200=I'm not sure what I did to deserve this, but please convey my thanks!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003300=I wonder if she's been getting the wrong idea about something...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003400=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003500=D...did you see...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003600=A monster...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003700=A real monster...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003800=A gift...? Now...?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10003900=Thank you, but it's not really the best time...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004000=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! You have no idea how glad I am to see you!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004100=I was worried ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; would be the one to come by with her...^c:1486b0;monster^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004200=Believe it or not, I do know someone who might be interested...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004300=^c:1486b0;One of my sisters^c:pop; happens to have a soft spot for...unusual pets...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004400=If you could get this ^c:d03e37;letter^c:pop; to one of the ^c:1486b0;merchants^c:pop;, they can pass it on.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004500=They travel around the world a lot after all.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004600=^c:1486b0;Max^c:pop; is asking if the store is ready to cope with the increase in demand?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004700=I think...he's probably overestimating how popular this event is going to be...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004800=But tell him I said yes. I don't see any problems.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004810=Ah ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, you must have received my letter yes?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10004900=Oh, hello ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005000=Things have been a bit blue around here lately...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005100=It's been a long time since I was last able to contact my family back in the ^c:1486b0;woodlands^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005200=Even if ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop; managed to get us connected to the postal service...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005300=There still isn't a good way to send post to other people...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005400=I've been thinking for a while that I could open up a small ^c:1486b0;post office^c:pop; in this ^c:1486b0;shop^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005500=But I'm not sure we'd be able to accommodate it right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005600=Nor do I have agreement from the local ^c:1486b0;postmen^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005700=I can help you out!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005800=Good luck!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10005900=Yes... Thank you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006000=Really? You'd be willing to do that for me?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006100=Thank you!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006200=I suppose the first step would be to expand the ^c:1486b0;shop^c:pop; a bit...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006300=We need a ^c:d03e37;counter^c:pop; for handling post and a ^c:d03e37;postbox^c:pop; at least...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006400=I think this should help you get started!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006500=Really, thank you for agreeing to help me, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006600=Normally I have to do everything myself around here...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006700=This is great, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006800=I'd say we're halfway there...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006900=Now if we could just find a couple of ^c:1486b0;reliable postmen^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10006910=I'd try asking some of the Murmur merchants by the town square.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007000=The Murmurs tend to travel, so they know a lot of people!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007100=Have you heard anything about ^c:1486b0;reliable postmen^c:pop; yet?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007200=We'll need a couple of them to agree to our proposal before we can actually start sending post...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007300=Hello, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. I had a couple of ^c:1486b0;postmen^c:pop; pass through!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007400=It looks like we're all set for post collection!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007500=Now we just need someone to send the first letter!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007600=This isn't quite enough to compensate you for everything you've done...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007700=So how about this: come by any time you like and you can send post completely free!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007800=You just need to use the ^c:d03e37;counter^c:pop; over there and it should be pretty simple!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007810=And now that we’ve got expanded shipping capabilities, I bet we could start using that new service...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007820=^c:1486b0;Honey.Comb^c:pop;, that’s it! It’s great for ordering products and selling items right from your farm!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007830=I’ll get the ^c:1486b0;Catalogue^c:pop; and ^c:1486b0;Shipping Station^c:pop; in stock soon, keep an eye out for it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007840=See you around ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10007900=Hello, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. Here to post a letter?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008000=There's someone here to see you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008100=Yep!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008200=...there is?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008300=Who is it? You didn't get a name?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008400=What did they look like? A bit robotic?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008500=What did she want? She wanted me to come back, didn't she?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008600=Who would watch the ^c:1486b0;store^c:pop; then?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008700=As much as I'd like to, I have other responsibilities now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008800=I can't just forget about them and run off into the woodlands...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10008900=Things are not so simple. Please let her know that.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009000=You know where the ^c:d03e37;counter^c:pop; is then!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009100=I think you might be the only person actively sending anything these days...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009200=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;? What are you doing here?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009300=^c:1486b0;Rem^c:pop; got you in?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009400=Well that's a relief...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009500=I was beginning to think no one was coming!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009600=I shudder to think what might happen if no one is around to watch the store...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009700=What's with this place?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009800=Hmm?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10009900=This is just my home village. Maybe you ran into my sisters while you were here?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010000=So did you bring a way for us to escape?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010100=...no.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010200=You came in here with no way out? So we're both stuck now?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010300=Well this is a bit unfortunate...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010400=How was the store when you were last there?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010500=It's still intact...right?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010510=I-
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010700=...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010800=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, perhaps you could give us a moment?
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10010900=Thank you for coming all the way out here for me. I didn't expect anyone to go so far.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011000=But it looks like I still have a few more things to deal with first.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011100=I'll make my own way back once I'm done here.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011200=The ^c:1486b0;Tavern^c:pop; has been a bit lonely of late...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011300=So if you feel like you want a roomie, I probably wouldn't say no...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011400=But we can talk about that later. There will be plenty of time.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011500=^c:1486b0;Rem^c:pop;, send ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop; back.
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011600=...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011700=...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011800=I got a weird feeling this morning...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10011900=Like most other mornings, I was just rearranging the store items...
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10012000=But when I turned my back for a bit, some of the items went missing!
staxel.village.dialogue.Meek.line:10012100=I might have been daydreaming... but that does make me anxious.
