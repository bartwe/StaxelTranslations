staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10001600=Oh! But maybe that was a bit rude of me.
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10001700=I didn't mean to suggest I wasn't thankful!
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10001800=Just disappointed. In the circumstances. Not in you.
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10001900=I suppose I should give you some kind of reward?
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10002000=Maybe that will be of some use to you?

staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10002700=Where do I live?
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10002800=Why, I certainly cannot tell you that! We fey value our privacy!
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10002900=Do I miss being coated in rubbish?
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10003000=Well... I did spend many a year that way...
staxel.village.dialogue.Alua.line:10003100=But no, of course not! I had even begun to forget the scent of flowers!
