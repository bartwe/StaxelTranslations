staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000100=Ah, hello there.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000200=I suppose it was you who called me out here?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000300=No?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000400=In that case, how can I help you?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000500=Nothing really.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000600=So we have this great game idea. You start off on an island after inheriting...
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000700=I see. Do let me know if you find the person who called me over.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000800=Wait. Let me stop you right there.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10000900=Your pitching technique is abysmal!
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001000=But I'll give you a chance. Believe it or not, but I'm quite the gamer myself.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001100=While I was waiting, I toured the island and thought up a few riddles.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001200=If you can solve them and find me, I'll consider listening to your pitch.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001300=Ready?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001400=As sturdy as an oak, but not quite the same,
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001500=Good for a drink, but never a game.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001600=Got it?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001700=Ah! So you solved my riddle?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001800=Was it too easy?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10001900=Very well. Try this one on for size:
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002000=A certain fanatic gave this to you.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002100=At first it was small, but with your help it grew.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002200=Do you know what I'm talking about?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002300=Well now. It would seem you're quite good at this.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002400=Then... I suppose I have one last riddle for you.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002500=What have I got in my pocket?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002600=...handses?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002700=That's not a riddle!
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002800=I apologise, that was unfair.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10002900=Let's try this again.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003000=The village, like a clockwork puzzle, ticks.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003100=At its core, a single cog clicks.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003200=That's all I'll say for now.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003300=Hello again, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003400=My presence is merely a formality; it's ^c:1486b0;Damian^c:pop; you should be talking to.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003500=Hello there.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003600=Ah, thank you for taking ^c:1486b0;Damian^c:pop; off my hands for a bit.
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003700=I trust he wasn't too much of a pain?
staxel.village.dialogue.JamieExec.line:10003800=He means well...he's just a little on the competitive side.
