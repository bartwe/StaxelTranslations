staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000100=Oh! I...I didn't expect to see you here...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000200=Uh... How did you even get here? Those devices are one time use and rather hard to make...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000300=It was that ^c:1486b0;scientist^c:pop;, wasn't it?
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000400=I just wanted to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; back, you know?
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000500=We all wanted that, but he just wouldn't come...kept talking about duty in his letters...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000600=It was really hard to build something that could transfer objects from place to place!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000700=It was one-time-use too...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000800=How did she even fix it?
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000900=Well never mind. You're here now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001000=At least one of you came willingly...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001100=I'm here to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; back.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001200=Oh...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001300=I shouldn't really help you, but...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001400=It's hard to see him so distressed.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001500=Perhaps it was truly wrong of me to drag him back. Maybe he'll come back of his own free will someday...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001600=Alright. I'll help you. It won't be easy though...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001700=We didn't want him to run away so we moved him somewhere...special...for the time being.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001800=If you could get me a few items I should be able to pull together something that will whisk you past the barrier.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001900=There should be ^c:d03e37;five components^c:pop;. If you look around the ^c:1486b0;tree houses^c:pop; here you should find them.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002000=We shouldn't be seen talking until you find the ^c:d03e37;five components^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002100=It would be bad if they suspected something was happening...
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002200=Yes, this looks like everything we need!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002300=Now if you just give me a minu-
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002400=I apologise, the device initiated before I was quite ready.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002500=I hope I didn't cause you too much unnecessary concern...?
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002510=That's great, we need to figure out where Tomti has taken ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop; and ^c:1486b0;Vorlen^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002511=Could you take a look around the ^c:1486b0;Town Hall^c:pop; and the ^c:1486b0;Museum^c:pop;?  
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002520=There may be some clues there. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002530=I understand that you're probably very busy right now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002540=But please come back soon. This town can't work without ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop; after all. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002550=Oh! You managed to convince ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; to fix it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002560=Is that the ^c:d03e37;teleporter^c:pop;? I don't trust that... but you should definitely use it. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002570=I'm out of options anyway... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002580=I should have spent more time with ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002590=Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. I was just looking for you. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002600=Thank you so much for finding ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002610=I hope he hasn't cause you much trouble. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002620=I just finished talking with him and he was in a much better mood. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002630=Judging by that, I doubt he'll be causing any more trouble... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002640=Not for the time being anyway. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002650=Well... I'll be going back to the ^c:1486b0;Treetop Village^c:pop; now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002660=We'll keep ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop; out of your hair for now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002670=Hi ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I was looking for you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002680=I didn't expect to be back here after that previous... situation. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002690=I generally don't leave the ^c:1486b0;Treetop Village^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002700=There is always someone to converse with, or construction to be done. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002710=But there is a slight problem... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002720=Remember that teleporter I used to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; home? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002730=Well, my brother ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop; took it. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002740=We don't know where he could have gotten to... He hasn't been around for a while. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002750=We've all been so busy. And with ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; not choosing not to stay... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002760=Maybe he's just a bit lonely... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002770=Sorry... lets get off that tangent for now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002780=^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop; has taken ^c:1486b0;Maximilian^c:pop; with him! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002790=I think he may have taken ^c:1486b0;Vorlen^c:pop; as well. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002800=Can you help me look for clues? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002810=Yes!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002820=Not right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002830=Are you ready? We need to find ^c:1486b0;Tomti^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002840=Yes!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002850=Not right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002860=Have you managed to find any clues? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002870=Hopefully we can find something about their whereabouts... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002880=Could you take a look around the ^c:1486b0;Town Hall^c:pop; and the ^c:1486b0;Museum^c:pop;?  
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002890=You found something. Great! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002900=It looks like a ^c:d03e37;fragment^c:pop; of a ^c:d03e37;teleporter^c:pop;... maybe. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002910=If you can find another ^c:d03e37;fragment^c:pop;, it might give us more to go on! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002920=Make sure to check around the ^c:1486b0;Town Hall^c:pop; and the ^c:1486b0;Museum^c:pop;?  
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002930=Great! Those look like parts of a ^c:d03e37;teleporter^c:pop;... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004800=They still look in decent condition. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004900=Let me take those. I'll quickly assemble them back together... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10005000=I figured... since she managed last time... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10005100=I don't know how ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; did it... You may need to ask her to help. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10005200=I don't know how ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; managed to do it...  
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10005300=Go see her for me, I think she will help out.
