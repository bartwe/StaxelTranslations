staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000100=Oh! I...I didn't expect to see you here... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000200=Uh... How did you even get here? Those devices are one time use and rather hard to make... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000300=It was that ^c:1486b0;scientist^c:pop;, wasn't it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000400=I just wanted to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; back, you know? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000500=We all wanted that, but he just wouldn't come...kept talking about duty in his letters... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000600=It was really hard to build something that could transfer objects from place to place! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000700=It was one-time-use too... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000800=How did she even fix it? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10000900=Well never mind. You're here now. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001000=At least one of you came willingly... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001100=I'm here to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; back.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001200=Oh... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001300=I shouldn't really help you, but... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001400=It's hard to see him so distressed. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001500=Perhaps it was truly wrong of me to drag him back. Maybe he'll come back of his own free will someday... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001600=Alright. I'll help you. It won't be easy though... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001700=We didn't want him to run away so we moved him somewhere...special...for the time being. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001800=If you could get me a few items I should be able to pull together something that will whisk you past the barrier. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10001900=There should be ^c:d03e37;five components^c:pop;. If you look around the ^c:1486b0;tree houses^c:pop; here you should find them. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002000=We shouldn't be seen talking until you find the ^c:d03e37;five components^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002100=It would be bad if they suspected something was happening... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002200=Yes, this looks like everything we need! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002300=Now if you just give me a minu- 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002400=I apologise, the device initiated before I was quite ready. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002500=I hope I didn't cause you too much unnecessary concern...? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002600=Uh... he took ^c:1486b0;Maximilian;^c:pop; to his hideout? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002700=Maybe he's a bit lonely I... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002800=^c:1486b0;{0-cecile_name}^c:pop; helped making a new teleporter! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10002900=Will you help me find him? Here's ^c:d03e37;Hideout Teleporter;^c:pop;! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003000=It's really important..! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003100=Please come back to me soon. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003200=We should have spent more time with ^c:1486b0;PH_Name^c:pop;.. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003300=I hope you find him. 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003400=Oh..hi ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I was looking for you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003500=There might be a slight problem... Remember that Teleporter I used to bring ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; home? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003600=Well...my brother ^c:1486b0;PH_Name^c:pop; took it... 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003700=Can you help me look for clues? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003800=Yes!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10003900=Not right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004000=Could you please help find ^c:1486b0;PH_Name^c:pop;? 
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004100=Yes!
staxel.village.dialogue.Rem.line:10004200=Not right now.
