staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000100=Hey there, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000200=I've been doing a bit of thinking recently...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000300=Sure it's fun to just skate around and catch bugs, but I think I can do something more...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000400=Once upon a time, things were quite different for me, you know?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000500=I didn't always have quite this much freedom of expression!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000600=So I'd like to pass that opportunity on to others too!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000700=But to do that I'm going to need a little help from you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000800=What I'd like you to do is actually pretty easy!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10000900=I want you to make me a ^c:d03e37;small wagon^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001000=You know, a bit like the ones the Murmurs come by in to trade!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001100=Trouble is... I'm not even sure where to begin with that...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001200=Perhaps you could go talk to a few of them and see if they're willing to give you some advice?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001300=Oh, you managed to convince them to give up a ^c:d03e37;wagon blueprint^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001400=That's great! Thanks ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001500=I'll be waiting right here to see it finished!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001600=Yes! This is exactly what I was talking about, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001700=Great job! Soon I'll be able to show people the meaning of individual freedom!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001800=For now, let's just see how this goes before we think about expanding any further!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10001900=Thanks lots for all your help, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002000=Feel free to take a look around when I have my wares out!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002100=Did you manage to find anything out from the Murmurs?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002200=I really think it would help to get some idea how their ^c:d03e37;wagons^c:pop; are built!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002300=Ohh! It's so much nicer than I imagined!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002400=You've done a great job, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002500=Now I just need you to set it up somewhere for me!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002600=Just place my ^c:d03e37;store sign^c:pop; down somewhere with the ^c:d03e37;wagon^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002700=I'll be waiting right here to see it finished!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002800=How about it, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10002900=Just place my ^c:d03e37;store sign^c:pop; down somewhere with the ^c:d03e37;wagon^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003000=That's all we have left to do!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003100=Oh... You mean start selling different types of clothing?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003200=I... Hmm... Maybe...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003300=Okay! I can't imagine why anyone would want anything else, but it's worth a shot!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003400=I guess we need to start prototyping some new outfits then...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003500=Could you come back tomorrow so I can have some time to think?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003600=Right! ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I've figured it out!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003700=All I need is for you to make me these ^c:d03e37;prototypes^c:pop; I came up with!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003800=I think some of the materials might be a little hard to come by...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10003900=But if you scour all the ^c:1486b0;portal islands^c:pop;, you just might find them!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004000=I still need some time to think...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004100=Could you come back tomorrow?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004200=Ohhh... I didn't know this style of clothing could look so good...!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004300=Maybe this really will do the trick!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004400=Now if only we had a bit more space to lay them out for sale... Hehe!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004500=Please! That'll be all, honest!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004600=...probably...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004700=Just make one of those and place it with the ^c:d03e37;wagon^c:pop; so we have space!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004800=How's it going with those ^c:d03e37;prototypes^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10004900=I think a couple of new ^c:1486b0;portal islands^c:pop; might have opened!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005000=Might be worth looking there if you can't find what you need!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005100=I'm counting on you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005200=That's perfect, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005300=I really hope this helps to sell a few more things!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005400=I need to expand more so I can start showing people what freedom of expression is on other islands too!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005500=You were a big help, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005600=I hope you'll come by and buy something sometime!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005700=Hey! ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005800=So maybe things aren't going as well as I'd hoped...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10005900=Sure, people come and take a look every now and then, but I haven't really sold anything much...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006000=What do you think it could be?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006100=Are my styles just not trendy enough?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006200=I think you need to diversify...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006300=...Diversify? You think I need to sell more styles?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006400=Hey! That's not a bad idea!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006500=We could start selling more tees with bug prints and-
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006600=No! Not like that...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006610=Hey, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006620=You know... I've been avoiding this for some time, but ^c:1486b0;Emilia^c:pop; being around made me think about it...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006630=There's...a real market for that kind of style, isn't there?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006640=You know, with all the frills and poofy dresses, and all that?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006650=It's...not really my thing, but it'd be nice to have a friend wearing clothing you designed, right?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006660=And I'm sure it'd sell well overseas!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006670=There's only one real problem, and that's what I need you for, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006680=With these kind of clothes some of the materials are pretty rare.
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006690=Like...extremely rare! I doubt you'd find them if you searched your whole life normally...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006700=But I do know one place that might have them...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006710=This should get you there. If you look around a bit, I think you'll find what we need!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006720=You really should head over to ^c:1486b0;that island^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006730=I'd go myself, but... Well there are reasons why I can't.
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006740=Besides, you're really good at this kind of thing, aren't you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006750=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, you're back!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006760=How did it go?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006770=About the castle...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006780=Hm?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006790=Oh, you probably shouldn't think too hard about things you saw there!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006800=^c:1486b0;Emilia^c:pop; and I used to be pretty close, but there isn't much more to say on the matter...
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006810=Freedom of expression really is important, huh?
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006820=Thanks for the materials! They'll be perfect for what I had in mind!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006830=If you come back tomorrow, you can probably see them first-hand!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006840=Your help really was invaluable, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006850=I hope this is enough to show at least some of my appreciation!
staxel.village.dialogue.TomboyPrimary.line:10006860=Oh, and feel free to give me a yell if you decide you want a roomie!
