staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000100=Hey, wanna give me a ha-
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000200=Hmm. Not sure I've seen ya around.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000300=I'd shake yer 'and but I don't think ya'd appreciate the oil!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000400=The name's ^c:1486b0;{0-name}^c:pop; though.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000500=If y'ever have any crafting needs, I can help out!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000600=Hmm? Is that yer ^c:d03e37;farm license^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000700=I'm guessin' ^c:1486b0;{0-mayor_name}^c:pop; sent ya about the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; then?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000800=It's a bit of a task, but I figure it'll get ya familiar with workin' around here!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10000900=Wonderful work {0-playername}!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001000=That barn almos' brought a tear ta my eye!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001010=If ya haven't been ta see him already, I think ^c:1486b0;{0-mayor_name}^c:pop; would love ta hear about it too!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001020=I hope ta see more o' yer good work around the place!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001030=Come back anytime ya need some materials from the store or some advice!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001100=See, this here is a ^c:d03e37;marker^c:pop; designed ta plot out the land belongin' to the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001200=They come in aaall shapes and sizes. Ya seen the ^c:d03e37;mailboxes^c:pop; around? Same deal.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001300=Jus' shove 'er into the ground-makin' sure ya got the rotation right!-and you'll be on track in no time!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001400=You can take a look at it anytime after that to get an idea of what's missin'!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001500=HOWEVER! And keep this firmly in mind!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001600=That ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; ain't gonna build itself. You gotta do that part yerself.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001700=You'll have ta chop down trees fer ^c:d03e37;wood^c:pop;, turn 'em into blocks, and build it up bit by bit.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001800='Course, ya can always buy some o' the blocks at the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10001900=Others parts might be a bit harder to come by...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002000=Now off you trot. Go find a nice spot for that ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; and come back to me with some ^c:d03e37;wood^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002100=An ^c:d03e37;axe^c:pop; oughta help out with that!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002200=Once ya have the ^c:d03e37;wood^c:pop; in hand, I'll show ya how ta turn it inta more interestin' things!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002300=Ready ta learn the ways o' the master builder?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002400=It's actually pretty easy!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002500=All ya need is three things: ingredients, a ^c:d03e37;blueprint or recipe^c:pop;, and ^c:d03e37;craftin' stations^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002600=The stations ya need ta get the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; done are all set up in the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop; already.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002700=Feel free ta borrow 'em anytime! Jus' don' try to run off with 'em...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002800=When structures get vandalised... well we ain't gonna be usin' 'em 'till they're fixed.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10002900=Yer gonna need some ^c:d03e37;raw wood^c:pop; for this next bit!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003000=Go chop down a few o' them big trees around the village!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003100=So anyway.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003200=This ^c:d03e37;blueprint^c:pop; will show ya how to make the basic ^c:d03e37;trough^c:pop; for the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003300=I suspect ya already know how to make a few more basic blocks though.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003400=Ya need to use the ^c:d03e37;blueprint^c:pop; in order ta memorise it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003500=Then ya can find it again anytime in the blueprint tab of yer inventory.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003600=I'll give ya a moment ta do that. Talk to me again when yer all set!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003700=With that outta the way, it's just a case o' putting the bits and pieces together!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003800=Each step in the ^c:d03e37;blueprint^c:pop; uses a particular type o' ^c:d03e37;craftin' station^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10003900=If ya need ta ^c:d03e37;saw^c:pop; somethin', a ^c:d03e37;saw bench^c:pop; will do that for ye!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004000=If ya wanna ^c:d03e37;assemble^c:pop; somethin', an ^c:d03e37;assembly station^c:pop; is the way to go!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004100=Makes sense right?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004120=Ya wanna set the items down on the left side o' the station. The final result ya take from the right!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004140=Interactin' with the middle o' the station will usually set 'er goin'!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004200=These should cover some o' the items needed ta make the ^c:d03e37;trough^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004300=Start by usin' the ^c:d03e37;saw bench^c:pop; in the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop; ta make some ^c:d03e37;lumber^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004400=If memory serves, the ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; needs a couple o' ^c:d03e37;troughs^c:pop;, some walls, and a roof.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004500=Once ya have all the parts, go finish off that ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004520=I'm sure I don't hafta remind ya how to build a good structure!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004540=Jus' put down some blocks to make four nice walls.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004560=Make sure ya don't forget the door or ya might run inta some problems...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004580=Then cover it over with a solid roof of blocks to keep out the rain!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004585=It really doesn't matter what type o' barn ya build. We don' have a solid blueprint!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004590=Jus' keep most o' the structure inside the glowy bits and it'll be all good!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004600=I'll be waitin' to hear all about it when yer done!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004700=How's that ^c:1486b0;barn^c:pop; goin'?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004800=Makin' good progress?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004900=Come see me with yer ^c:d03e37;farm license^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10004950=You'll get it from ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005000=^c:1486b0;Mayor^c:pop; said ta give a good rundown on buildin' once ya had it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005100=Hmmm... didja lose yer ^c:d03e37;barn sign^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005200=I can give ya a new one, but it'll cost ya {0-currency}{1-sign}...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005300=Yes please!

staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005600=Alrighty, here ya go!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005700=I'm afraid ya can't afford that...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005800=Maybe come back later?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10005900=Mmm... looks like the ^c:d03e37;{0-ttm}^c:pop; is missin'...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006000=I can give ya a new one, but it'll cost ya {0-currency}{1-price}...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006100=Yes please!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006200=Not right now.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006300=Alrighty, here ya go!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006400=So m'store is in a bit o' trouble eh?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006500=I can sell ya some bits to fix 'er up at a premium if ya need...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006600=What can I do ya for?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10006700=Cash Register ({0-currency}{1-reg})

staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10007800=Ya need some bits ta fix up the ^c:1486b0;grocery store^c:pop;?

staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008000=Shelves ({0-currency}{1-shelf})
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008100=Nothing right now
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008200=Doin' alright, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008300=I've been thinkin' a lot recently...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008400=My store could be doin' so much better.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008500=If only there was less competition, if ya catch my drift...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008600=Take out Leif? Got it.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008700=...what?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008800=Naw, don't get the wrong idea! ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; is a good friend!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10008900=We ain't gonna do anythin' bad to him...'cept maybe steal some of his customers.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009000=How are we gonna do that? Well, by stockin' up on all the stuff he has that we could!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009100=Oh, and quite a few bits he doesn't!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009200=I jus' need ya to expand the ^c:1486b0;buildin' store^c:pop; a bit so we can stock 'em!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009300=How's the whole expansion thing goin'?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009400=We're gonna blow ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; outta the water!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009500=It's always impressive how quick ya get that stuff done, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009600=I swear, I jus' gotta blink and suddenly the work's all done!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009700=Maybe I'm jus' too used to the ol' style of contractors...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009800=Now, the job itself may be the main reward, but I thought I'd give ya a little somethin' extra!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10009900=Let's see how well ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; does at outshinin' us now, eh?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010000=Hm? You wanna know about ^c:1486b0;Rosie's^c:pop; ol' rabbit?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010100='Fraid I wasn't in the neighbourhood back then...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010200=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, I hate to be the one to say this, but yer buildin' too much!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010300=At this rate, I'm never gonna be able to keep up with yer demand for resources!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010400=We jus' don' have the supplies...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010500=Now...if ya'd be willin' to help with tha', we might be able to change things for the better!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010600=How about ya start with a quick survey of the island as a whole?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010700=Jus' run around a bit an' bring me ^c:d03e37;50 raw stone^c:pop; an' ^c:d03e37;50 raw wood^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010800=See if ya can find some promisin' sources!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10010900=Any luck findin' us some new sources o' raw materials?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011000=Jus' wander a bit and see if ya can find a good place to get ^c:d03e37;50 raw stone^c:pop; an' ^c:d03e37;50 raw wood^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011100=Ah, so ya did manage to find some untapped sources, did ya? That's good to hear.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011200=Now, I can't exactly ask ya to bring all the materials in yerself. That'd be too much work!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011300=So what I want ya to do is take each o' these ^c:d03e37;markers^c:pop; and use 'em to designate a resource.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011400=Some o' them need trees, some need open quarries.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011500=Once they're all marked up, I can start plannin' better ways o' sourcin' 'em.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011600=Jus' lemme know when it's all set up!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011700=Looks like we're missin' a few more resource spots.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011800=Ya jus' gotta place them ^c:d03e37;markers^c:pop; next to trees or quarries as the marker says and make sure they're valid!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10011900=There ya are, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012000=Jus' got word that some 'o my people are preparin' to work with those resources, ya marked!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012100=Good work out there!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012200=Seems like we're gonna be pretty good on materials for a while now!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012300=This' jus' a li'l somethin' as thanks fer savin' the business again!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012400=Even if ya were the one who put it at risk in the first place!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012500=The time has come, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012600=We're gonna beat out my good-for-nothin' ex-husband for monopoly of all the islands in the region!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012700=It was my store that got 'im that big tradin' conglomerate in the first place!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012800=But it ain't gonna be easy. Not by far.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10012900=I got a multi-step plan that's guaranteed to succeed, but a whole lot of it rests on yer shoulders!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013000=See, the biggest barrier to dominatin' the other islands is how much we can ship in an' outta the island.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013100=The bottleneck there is all in the ^c:1486b0;airship dock^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013200=If ya could expand both sides a bit, it'd be a great first step to ownin' the whole region!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013300=This should give ya a good idea about how to proceed!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013400=Still workin' on the ^c:1486b0;airship dock^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013500=Hard work, I'd imagine, eh? Yer doin' good though! Fantastic even!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013600=Good work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Ya really nailed the expansion!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013700=Already got a bunch o' airships inbound to start ferryin' goods more efficiently!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013800=Trouble is...our airships aren't exactly the fastest out there...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10013900=We're somethin' like 10-20% behind in terms o' speed compared to our competitors...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014000=Ya think ya could work somethin' up to fix the issue? Maybe some fancy new parts or somethin'?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014100=This here is an idea I had...but I ain't exactly figured out all the specifics...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014200=Maybe ya could run it on by ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop;? Heard she was all big on science-like stuff.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014300=Could ya run that plan on by ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014400=She might have some ideas on how to make it work.
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014500=No dice, huh?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014600=Dunno why ^c:1486b0;Cecile^c:pop; is so stuck on magic not bein' real...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014700=Too many hours in the books, maybe?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014800=But if it's magic we need...maybe ya wanna go say hi to ^c:1486b0;Cirahna^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10014900=She seems pretty in the know about magic, right?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015000=We need some magic, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015100=Go see if ^c:1486b0;Cirahna's^c:pop; willin' to help!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015200=Better luck this time, I hope?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015300=Mmm... Yea, that makes more sense!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015400=Alright, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Ya up for a little craftin' work?
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015500=We're gonna need two sets 'o ^c:d03e37;airship parts^c:pop; to get the things movin' faster!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015600=Don' worry too much about the instructions! It ain't as scary as it looks!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015700=Jus' do it one step at a time and yer gonna be fine!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015800=Remember, we need two o' the ^c:1486b0;weird magic airship parts^c:pop; to make these things fly!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10015900=Bring 'em on over as soon as yer done!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016000=These are perfect, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016100=Couldn't have made a better prototype myself!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016200=Now that just leaves one last teeny thing...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016300=See, the key to beatin' out that ol' thief's monopoly is bestin' 'im at 'is own game!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016400=We're gonna need somethin' to intercept all 'is communications an' beat 'im to the punch!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016500=Go set that up somewhere outside the village and I'll get these airships into production!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016600=That ^c:1486b0;communications tower^c:pop; is gonna be the key to our success!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016700=Make sure ya set it up somewhere it'll get good reception!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016800=Although, on this island, I suppose that's just about anywhere!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10016900=Already got some communications comin' in! Good work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! I knew I could count on ya!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017000=We're gonna dominate the market in no time! Maybe I'll even manage to buy my ol' business back from that greedy ol'...
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017100=Anyhow, I hafta thank ya again, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. This wouldn't have been possible without ya!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017200=This is jus' a li'l token of my admiration for ya. And my undying thanks!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017300=If yer ever lookin' for someone to help around yer home, I'd always be willin'!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017400=Jus' come on by an' say the word!
staxel.village.dialogue.Mechanic.line:10017500=Eh? What's this? A ^c:d03e37;broom^c:pop;?
