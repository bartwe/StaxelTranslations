staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000100=Oh, hello. We almost didn't see you there. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000200=Are you here to attend our masquerade this year? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000300=It's a bit unfortunate but we may need to cancel it this time... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000400=A few of our subjects are... well... not the most civil. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000500=It would seem the manor has been put completely out of sorts. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000510=Perhaps you might help out by catching some of the mischievous fairies? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000520=Only the mischievous ones though! Leave the innocent fairies be! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000530=You could also help by repairing some of the damaged rooms... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000600=What to do... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000700=What's going on?
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000800=What can I do to help?
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000820=Which rooms are left?
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000900=I caught a fairy!
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000920=...
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001000=You're willing to help us out? Fantastic! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001100=The core of the matter is that the manor has become a bit... disorderly. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001200=There are two things you can do that would exceedinly useful. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001300=The first is to hunt down all the mischievous fairies. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001400=That way we might be able to recover some of the bits and pieces they made off with! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001500=You can most likely catch them flying around by using a ^c:d03e37;bug net^c:pop;. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001600=Don't disturb innocent fairies though! Our kin do not usually intend harm! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001620=A mischievous fairy can be recognised by its reddish glow! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001700=As for putting the manor's rooms back into order... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001900=Otherwise, you can try and put the manor's rooms back into order... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001920=We imagine you might find some pieces of furniture out of place in other rooms... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001940=Maybe some of it you'll have to recover by capturing mischievous fairies... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10001800=It looks like we're all set on that front! Good work! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002000=It looks like some furniture is missing from room 101 in the left wing. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002100=Room 104 in the right wing could probably do with a bit of reorganising. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006800=You still need to put everything in room 105 back in its rightful place! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006900=I really want to see room 106 restored to its former glory... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10007000=If you go upstairs, room 203 is missing a part of its roof! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10007100=Room 204 can barely be called a room any more... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10007200=We probably need to rebuild a chunk of the roof in room 206 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10007300=Room 207 is in a bit of a sorry state... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10007400=Mischievous fairies really did a number on room 208! Please work out what's missing! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002200=Normally we would already be holding our grand masquerade... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002300=However, certain mischievous fey have taken to pulling apart our manor... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002400=It was hard work bringing it here from the fairy realm! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002500=Would that a kind soul might help us repair the damage... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002600=Why at such an important time...? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002700=Our patience with some of our kin begins to wear thin... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002800=Ah, excellent! May we take them off your hands for disciplining? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10002900=Sure!
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003000=Um... disciplining?
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003100=Hmm... wait... those-! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003200=Ah, no! What did we say about snatching innocent fairies?! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003300=Hold still little one, we'll soon have you free... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003400=Please focus on catching mischievous fairies only... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003500=We sense no fairies in our presence... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003600=Are you certain that you found some? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003700=Please do let us know if you manage to capture one! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003800=Well now... if you're certain you won't comply... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10003900=Let us know if you change your mind. 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004000=Now... let us see what they made off with! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004100=Ah, excellent, it would appear that we have recovered some parts of the wall! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004200=These may help you with the repairs! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004300=Oh, it would appear this little one was making off with a segment of roofing! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004400=Perhaps it may be of use in tidying up one of the rooms? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004500=Aha! This would appear to be the table that was missing from 106! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004600=How did it manage to bear this weight...? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004700=Regardless, please do return it to its rightful place! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004800=Oh my! It would appear the manor has been completely restored! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10004900=Excellent work {0-playername}! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005000=Now our masquerade can proceed as planned! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005100=For your hard work, please allow us to bestow these items upon you! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005200=Should you happen to come across any more mischievous fairies... 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005300=Do feel free to bring them to us and we'll see that you're well rewarded! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005400=Perhaps we might bequeath some of our designer furniture in exchange! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005500=The masquerade is all set to proceed as planned! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005600=What can we do for you on this fine day {0-playername}? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005700=I caught a fairy!
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005800=Nothing really!
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10005900=What would you like from us in exchange? 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006000=Arm Chair
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006100=Drawers
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006200=Sofa
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006300=Glass Table
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006400=Lamp
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006500=Large Table
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006700=Small Table
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10006600=A fine choice indeed! 
staxel.village.dialogue.festival.FeyQueen.line:10000840=Hmm...
