staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000200=...
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000300=Eh? What? Are these arms? Legs?
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000350=Am I me again?
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000400=Astounding! Fantastic!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000500=What did you do?
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000600=Ahh. You cannot imagine how wonderful it is to have arms and legs again!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000700=There is nothing quite comparable to spending a few decades as an insect...
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000800=Ah, but I seem to be getting ahead of myself.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000900=I am ^c:1486b0;{0-name}^c:pop;, once curator of a magnificent museum in a farawy land.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10000950=How did I come to be an insect?
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001000=Hmm... I do believe we should gloss over that for now.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001100=Perhaps if you pay me a visit ^c:1486b0;on the morrow^c:pop;, we might discuss a few details?
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001200=I must first reaccustom myself to this body and finally get some rest.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001300=You have no idea how long those blasted spiders were chasing me!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001500=Please, allow me a day to rest before we begin our discussions.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001600=Come back ^c:1486b0;on the morrow^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001700=Ah, what a fine day to be humanoid again!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001800=I cannot believe how comfortable the tavern floor was last night!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10001900=So. To business!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002000=I took the liberty of examining your 'village' in the early morning hours.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002100=As I suspected, and much to my horror I might add, you lack a ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002200=Perhaps you are not aware, but ^c:1486b0;museums^c:pop; are of paramount importance in these settings.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002300=Where else will you store and display all the valuables you uncover?
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002400=As such, I must impose upon you to construct such a venue.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002500=I have heard that you are already familiar with construction.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002600=I trust you to take care of the rest!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002700=Ah, but it is hard to find ways to occupy my time.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002800=I do hope things are progressing well with the ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10002900=I find myself particularly looking forward to the insect wing.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003000=Fantastic! Magnificent! A true marvel!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003100=In case it was not apparent, these are my impressions upon seeing our new ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003200=I cannot adequately express my thanks!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003300=First you restore me to humanoid form, then you erect a ^c:1486b0;museum^c:pop; in my honour.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003400=I am humbled. Truly. For your services, please take this.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003420=That right there is an ^c:d03e37;unpolished fossil^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003440=You might find them if you break rocks lying around the island.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003500=The ^c:d03e37;polishing machine^c:pop; can be used to clean up old ^c:d03e37;fossils^c:pop; for the museum and expand your collection!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003600=Should you ever find any interesting collectables, do come and see me!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003700=You are also free to populate the displays with them!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003800=I cannot wait to see you expand our insect collection!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10003900=Oh my! Is that a new discovery? I must record it immediately!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004000=For this one, I can award you ^c:d03e37;{0-newPoints} Vorlen encyclopaedia points^c:pop;, bringing your total to ^c:d03e37;{1-points}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004100=Goodness! {0-count} new discoveries! Allow me to add them to my records.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004200=For these you earn ^c:d03e37;{0-newPoints} Vorlen encyclopaedia points^c:pop;, bringing your total to ^c:d03e37;{1-points}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004250=Aha! Now this is a moment I have been anticipating!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004300=Collectable discoveries must be recorded!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004400=Come to me each time you make a new discovery and I will bestow upon you ^c:d03e37;Vorlen encyclopaedia points^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004500=Collect enough and extravagant treasures could be yours!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004600=For this batch of {0-count}, I will award you ^c:d03e37;{1-newPoints} points^c:pop;, bringing your total to ^c:d03e37;{2-points}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004700=Fabulous! You have broken ^c:d03e37;100 Vorlen encyclopaedia points^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004800=To commemorate this first milestone, I have prepared a set of ^c:d03e37;5 unpolished fossils^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10004900=Perhaps one might turn out to be a rarity!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005000=As a curator, I admit to a passing interest in monsters from the past.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005100=Those wails coming from the forest, however...
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005200=I would rather not be the one confirming their source.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005300=Ah, I see you have amassed over ^c:d03e37;200 points^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005400=Perhaps this will be a somewhat unorthodox reward, but I no longer have room for this painting.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005500=Keep up the excellent work!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005600=Marvellous, ^c:d03e37;300 points^c:pop;. I have met few people as studious of their surroundings!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005700=Perhaps someday we will manage to catalogue the entire island!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005800=Goodness! ^c:d03e37;400 points^c:pop; already?
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10005900=You must be quite the avid historian!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10006000=Almost reminds me of my younger self.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10006100=Incredible! I never thought to see someone reach ^c:d03e37;500 points^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10006200=For now, this is as much as I can offer you.
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10006300=I used to travel the world, digging up ancient treasures in those togs!
staxel.village.dialogue.CursedCurator.line:10006350=But perhaps the time has come to pass on the mantle. May they serve you well!
