staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10000200=Certainly took him long enough...
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10000300=Whatever it is, it's starting to smell a bit funny - I'll be happy to see it go!
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10000400=By the way, congratulations on your new pet!
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10000500=Must be nice to have such a good companion...
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10000600=It can get pretty lonely out here...
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10000700=You look a bit confused? Well, never mind, I have something for you too!
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10000800=These will definitely come in handy now that you have a pet...

staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001000=Feel free to browse the shelves and buy whatever you need any time!
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001100=But for now, you'd better get that ^c:d03e37;parcel^c:pop; out of here...
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001200=I'm not sure how much longer I can stand it.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001300=^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; sent you about ^c:1486b0;Rosemary's^c:pop; rabbit? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001400=Hmm... I...suppose I can remember something like that. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001500=Yes, yes. I remember! 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001600=The poor thing didn't look well at all. I think it must have been on its last legs when she picked it up... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001700=The poor child... I can't imagine how difficult the experience would have been for her at that age... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001800=She was enamoured with the creature too...  
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10001900=Ah, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! What brings you here today? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002000=^c:1486b0;Rosemary's^c:pop; new rabbit? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002100=Hmm... I know a fair bit about them, but you'd have to describe the symptoms... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002200=How is it behaving? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002300=It's very excitable.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002400=It's very confused.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002500=It's very withdrawn.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002600=Right, right. I see... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002700=And what about how it is around others? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002800=Extremely cuddly.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10002900=A dangerous beast.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003000=It ignores them.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003100=Alright, just one more thing. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003200=Is he eating right? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003300=About normal.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003400=Eating too much.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003500=Not eating.
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003600=Hmm... That might be serious... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003700=This might be able to help, but I can't be completely sure... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003800=Aha, I recognise that condition... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10003900=It's pretty common in rabbits...I remember seeing it many times in the forest. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10004000=It's lonely. 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10004100=Sometimes human companionship just isn't enough... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10004200=Have you thought about getting her another rabbit? 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10004300=^c:1486b0;Rowan^c:pop; tends to have pretty good connections for that kind of thing... 
staxel.village.dialogue.ShopKeepPrimary.line:10004400=Perhaps you could talk to him?
