staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000100=Fascinating!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000200=I've never seen such an agile mushroom before!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000300=Do you speak?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000400=Nod
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000500=Shake head
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000600=Oh? How odd! It seems you at least understand what I'm saying.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000700=That does rather bring into question your authenticity, however...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000800=Do you mind if I take a closer look?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10000900=Hmm, yes... Fascinating!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001000=How do your motor functions work? What, exactly is this?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001100=Eh?! What?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001200=Well.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001300=That was somewhat cruel of you...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001400=Though I suppose you must be a fellow mushroom-lover to have gone to such lengths.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001500=Perhaps I can consider forgiving you...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001600=I suppose I did ruin your costume...somehow?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001700=Maybe this would serve as sufficient compensation?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001800=I suppose we could talk a bit more about mushrooms sometime if you like?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10001900=Ah, if it isn't the 'mushroom'...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002000=How can I help you today?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002100=Hm? ^c:1486b0;Cirahna^c:pop; told you I was in trouble and needed help?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002200=I'll have you know I happen to like it this way!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002300=I didn't grow these for no reason!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002400=Mushrooms have very many useful properties and this island could certainly use some more.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002500=So if you wouldn't mind, perhaps you could return to ^c:1486b0;Cirahna^c:pop; and clarify things for her?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002600=Still here?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002700=I'd appreciate it if you could go talk to ^c:1486b0;Cirahna^c:pop; about this for me!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10002900=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003000=What happened?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003100=For a moment, I felt as though I had become one with the mushrooms!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003200=Oh, but you cannot imagine how glorious it was!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003300=But...why has it suddenly become so easy to breathe?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003400=Where did all my pets disappear to?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003500=You didn't have anything to do with this, did you?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003600=Hello, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003700=You know, regardless of what you did last time, I'm sure you actually like mushrooms almost as much as I do...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003800=Why else would you have approached me in their guise the first time?
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10003900=For this reason, I have a bit of a favour to ask you...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004000=There's a very special place I want to show you. Somewhere few people can venture.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004200=Just let me know when you're ready to go.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004300=I'm ready.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004400=Not yet.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004500=Good! Then let's be off
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004600=This is my world, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004700=A special place that belongs to no one else.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004800=It's why I let ^c:1486b0;Cirahna^c:pop; convince me to come to the village in the first place.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10004900=But it's dying, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005000=The mycelium beneath the village is dying and soon there won't be any mushrooms left at all...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005100=We can still save it though! That's where you come in.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005200=There should be two very special ^c:d03e37;mushrooms^c:pop; in this realm.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005300=If you can get hold of their seeds and plant them in the village, we just might be able to do something!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005400=They shouldn't be hard to find, but they might be difficult to reach...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005500=One lies ^c:1486b0;deep beneath the ground^c:pop; and the other ^c:1486b0;high in the skies above^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005600=Once you have them, plant them in the village. One of each should be enough.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005700=Don't pick them though! We need them live and growing!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005800=If you find yourself back in the village, the ^c:d03e37;large mushroom^c:pop; in my house should transport you here.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10005900=I know I'm asking a lot, but good luck, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006000=Time is not unlimited, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006100=Find and plant the two types of ^c:d03e37;mushroom seeds^c:pop;! Don't pick them though!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006200=One lies ^c:1486b0;deep beneath the ground^c:pop; and the other ^c:1486b0;high in the skies above^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006210=The ^c:d03e37;Giant Mushroom^c:pop; can get you back if need be.
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006300=You did it, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006400=The mycelium is stabilising again!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006500=I knew you liked mushrooms just as much as I do!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006600=This is just a little something...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006700=Think of it as thanks not just for this time, but the times you've helped me in the past too!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006800=I know I haven't been the most welcoming of people...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10006900=But if you ever feel like you want to spice up your home with more mushrooms...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirl.line:10007000=You know where to find me!
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirlMushroom2.line:10004600=This is my world, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.MushroomGirlMushroom2.line:10004700=A special place that belongs to no one else.
