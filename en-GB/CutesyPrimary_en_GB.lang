staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000100=Hello, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! How are you today?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000200=I think it's high time we started considering an expansion of my  ^c:1486b0;patisserie^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000300=Don't you agree?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000400=A few more tools to make things just a liiitle bit easier!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000500=I have some pretty big orders coming up soon after all!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000600=Those should be all I need for now!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000700=Just a liiitle more expansion needed I think...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000800=Then everything will be just perfect!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10000900=Fantastic! Of course, I have to make sure you can bake first though!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001000=If you could whip up a nice ^c:1486b0;cheesecake^c:pop; that would be the perfect demonstration!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001100=The key with ^c:1486b0;cheesecakes^c:pop; is knowing exactly getting the cream cheese to room temperature!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001200=You'll get lumps otherwise...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001300=I can't wait to try it!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001400=Oh thank you, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! You're a lifesaver!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001500=Thinking about baking extravagant cakes without the extra machines was starting to give me a headache!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001600=To be honest, even thinking about how much work there is to do alone is keeping me awake at night...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001700=Hey...you know what?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001800=How would you like to try being my assistant?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001900=I would love to!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10001910=I'm a bit neutral on that...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002100=Oh, what a lovely aroma!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002200=Let me take a proper look at your work...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002300=Hmm...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002400=Mmmm~🎶! Exactly spot on!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002500=I could hardly have baked it better myself, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002600=From today onwards, you're my new assistant!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002700=I hope this will serve as payment for today's work!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002800=We have something pretty big coming up soon, so be sure to keep up with practice!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10002900=The time has come, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003000=Our first truly extravagant order! A high profile one too!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003100=Today, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, we prepare for a royal wedding!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003200=The venue is on another island so we can't attend in person, but it's up to us to bake the cake.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003300=A royal wedding... That brings back memories... It will have to be the most perfect cake I've ever baked!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003400=But before all that, we need to start with the samplers!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003500=We're on a tight deadline so I can't make them all myself...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003600=How about you try your hand at the ^c:1486b0;carrot wedding cake^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003700=It's not as hard as it sounds! Start by baking three simple ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop; and bring them to me!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003800=Ah~🎶! Three ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop;, just like I asked!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10003900=Good work, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Perfectly prepared!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004000=See these ^c:1486b0;rods^c:pop;? You need to combine them with the three ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004100=That will give you the completed ^c:1486b0;carrot wedding cake^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004200=Baking three simple ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop; is where you want to start!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004300=I'll be working on the other four samples!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004400=So much work to be done!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004500=Just combine the ^c:1486b0;rods^c:pop; with the three ^c:1486b0;carrot cakes^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004600=Wonderful! That's quite the load off my shoulders!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004700=But...um... I'm not sure how to say this...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004800=We seem to have a little bit of an emergency here...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10004900=Apparently the ^c:1486b0;prince^c:pop; himself has shown up on the island to meet the patissier in charge...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005000=That, in this case, would be me...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005100=But how about we pretend it's not? What if you go in my place and entertain him?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005200=I don't really want to be recognised. Besides, I still have a lot of work to do here!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005300=If you put these on, he'll definitely think you're the one in charge!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005400=Hurry, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005500=I don't want to risk having him in my ^c:1486b0;patisserie^c:pop;! I don't want to be recognised!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005600=Oh, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005700=You managed to keep the prince sufficiently entertained then?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005800=Wait...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10005900=Are those what I think they are?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006000=Did...did he just give you the ^c:1486b0;wedding rings^c:pop;...?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006100=...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006200=...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006300=Wow. I'm speechless.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006400=I knew he was a bit...dense, but this? And he's already left?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006500=Well...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006600=I suppose this isn't your fault so I shouldn't take it out on you!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006700=I'll hold onto the ^c:1486b0;rings^c:pop; for now, but here's your payment for today's antics.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006800=Let's hope the actual wedding goes a bit better...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10006900=Ah, did you lose your ^c:1486b0;rods^c:pop;? That's not good...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007000=Remember, they go in the cake. Not wherever you put them before...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007100=Did you lose the outfit I gave you?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007200=How on earth did you manage that?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007300=Please try to be more careful with this one...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007400=Hello, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007500=I have some troubling news...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007600=It seems we have a disillusioned ^c:1486b0;princess^c:pop; hiding out in our ^c:1486b0;town hall^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007700=I'd rather not be seen, so maybe you could run on over with the ^c:1486b0;wedding rings^c:pop;?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007800=That might help to calm her down...a little. Maybe.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10007900=If she's anything like I remember...probably not.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008000=I'd hurry over with those ^c:1486b0;wedding rings^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008100=I don't even want to imagine what they might be worth!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008200=You'll find the ^c:1486b0;princess^c:pop; hiding out in the ^c:1486b0;town hall^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008300=So returning the ^c:1486b0;rings^c:pop; wasn't enough to resolve the situation?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008400=Hm. I didn't think so either.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008500=Especially not with how the ^c:1486b0;prince^c:pop; is moping about in the ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop;...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008600=I have to say, I don't blame her for not wanting to see his face!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008700=I'd rather not have to either!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008800=But...perhaps you could go and try to smooth over the situation?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10008900=Whatever it is they want you to do, perhaps this time you should come back to me first?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009000=I'd go speak to the ^c:1486b0;prince^c:pop; myself, but I don't really want to see him either...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009100=You'll find him moping about the ^c:1486b0;tavern^c:pop;.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009200=Don't forget to take a ^c:1486b0;lemon pie^c:pop; to the ^c:1486b0;princess^c:pop; along with that ^c:1486b0;letter^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009300=Let me know if they give you something else to send...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009400=It's probably best to run it by me first!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009500=I'd deliver that ^c:1486b0;letter^c:pop; as quickly as you can!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009600=The wedding is coming up soon!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009700=Ahhh~🎶! That nightmare is finally over!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009800=You can't imagine how stressful that was on top of dealing with their cake...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10009900=How did you know what to say?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010000=Oh, that? My brother can be rather...dense at times.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010100=But the ^c:1486b0;princess^c:pop; I also know quite well.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010200=Given all the efforts I made on behalf of their marriage, perhaps I should be the one marrying her!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010300=That's a joke, of course. I wanted to leave the royal life behind.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010400=Being a patissier is far more fulfilling!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010500=Who would have known they'd ask me to bake my cake without even knowing who I was?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010600=Thank you, by the way, for playing the role admirably!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010700=I know this isn't much, but I think you've graduated from the role of assistant!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010800=From now on, we're equals in the baking world! Sort of anyway...this is still my ^c:1486b0;patisserie^c:pop;!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10010900=If you ever need a live-in patissier, do let me know though!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011000=I'd be delighted to take up the job!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011100=Is that...a letter? Let me take a look.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011200=Good lord.
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011300=What is this garbage? ^c:1486b0;Farm Fan^c:pop; has written more romantic poetry! About tractors!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011400=Let me just touch that up a bit...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011500=There we go! That should be safe to deliver now!
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011600=But...perhaps it would be good to send a ^c:1486b0;lemon pie^c:pop; along with it?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011700=A peace offering of a kind. You know how to make one, right?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011800=It went well, I take it?
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10011900=And I see you have a reply to deliver...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10012000=Ouch. I've seen more heartfelt prose in a law book...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10012100=Let me just touch that up again...
staxel.village.dialogue.CutesyPrimary.line:10012200=I think that should be good to go as is! You won't even need a gift to go along with it!
