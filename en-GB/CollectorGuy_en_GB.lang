staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000020=What's your name?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000030=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000040=Are you another friend? I don't have any more riddles prepared...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000050=But I think you will like where this takes you.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000060=Just so you know... I will notice if you change anything in the cave.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000070=So don't steal anything...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000080=...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000090=Hi?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000100=I don't know you...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000110=Why are you here? Are you going to take my stuff?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000120=Stay away from my things.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000130=Only my friends can come in here...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000140=You do seem alright though... but we're not friends!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000150=Or... Are we?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000160=No! you need to prove yourself first!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000170=If you can solve all my riddles, I'll let you see my lair.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000180=So lets have some fun! Here's riddle number one...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000190=I'm tall when I'm young but short when I'm old. What am I?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000200=These riddles aren't easy, but not just anyone can be my friend!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000210=Oh hey, you've actually found me.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000220=You're doing better than I expected!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000230=But if you really want to be my friend, you'll need to know a bit more about me.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000240=It's important that we share the same tastes.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000250=So lets see how you do, on riddle number two...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000260=Of all the food here, which tastes the best?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000270=I didn't expect you to make it!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000280=Good to know you have excellent taste...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000290=Because now you know what to bring for my birthday!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000300=That is, if I invite you...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000310=We don't truly know each other yet.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000320=For that to be true, you have to get to know my other friends too!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000330=So for riddle number three, this is my question to thee...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000340=I've got many friends, they're all here! But only one steals the spotlight with cheer! Who is it?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000350=Good!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000360=You know my friends!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000370=Now... I want my friends to always feel like they're at home.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000380=So I have to make sure there are enough toilets for everyone!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000390=You never know when one might break... that would be awkward!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000400=I'm thinking of getting one more. Just in case!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000410=So for riddle number four, you'll have to count the toilets on every floor...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000420=If I get one more, how many would I have then?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000430=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, what are you doing here?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000440=I don't recall planning a sleepover...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000450=Not that I mind!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000460=Around here, it's always time for a sleepover.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000470=You should come and find me in my game room. When it's sleepover time of course!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000480=Do you like my farm?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000490=It's pretty cool, isn't it?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000500=We can build you a house around here if you want.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000510=And maybe... We could visit each other from time to time!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000520=... You seem like you have something you want to ask me?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000530=Where did you get that hat?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000540=Let's give Max his hat back.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000550=Oh uh... I found it on the ground in my hallway.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000560=I wanted to give it to that old man... but he didn't seem very friendly...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000570=Figured I could just keep it, I think it fits me better anyway!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000580=He's pretty stressed right now...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10000590=He's very friendly!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005300=Oh... really?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005310=I don't want to cause any trouble...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005320=Could you give it to him for me? I'm not sure he wants to have me around...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005330=Anyway, thanks for stopping by ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, You're actually pretty nice!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005340=... Is there something else you want to say?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005700=Your sister, Rem, is worried about you.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005800=Your family wants you back home.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005810=But I don't want to go back to the ^c:1486b0;Treetop Village^c:pop;! It's no fun there, I'd rather stay here.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005820=At least here I can do some adventuring!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005830=Come home with me and talk with them.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005840=I'm not sure I want to do that...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005850=I'm gonna spend some time outside my home...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005860=Out of the cave, and on the surface. There are a lot of animals there, you know.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005870=Feel free to look around here after I leave. Just don't steal my stuff...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005880=Oh, and how about you come visit me again later!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005890=I'll be outside for a while, I think. Find me there!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005900=Aren't you gonna give that hat back? 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:10005910=I don't want that guy to get angrier with me... 
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000100=...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000200=The man with the tall hat just ran past.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000300=He was in a hurry, but he didn't seem too mad anymore!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000400=I do still feel bad though...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000500=Maybe I should come to your town after all... Maybe I can bring a gift or something...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000600=You got enough toilet paper there? How about toilets?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000700=Hmm... yes. I should at least go say sorry.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000800=Oh, my family too... I hope they're not too upset?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80000900=I was just so bored at the ^c:1486b0;Treetop Village^c:pop;. It would be good to see them again too.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001000=Thank you so much ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, let's play again some time soon!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001100=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;! Hey, I have great news!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001200=I'm coming to live here!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001300=My family and I have been talking a lot, over these past few days.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001400=^c:1486b0;Rem^c:pop; has finally agreed to let me come live here!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001500=This place is a lot more interesting, and I already know you!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001600=Even that ^c:1486b0;Mayor^c:pop; and I get along better now too... After I apologised for stealing his hat.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001700=Also, ^c:1486b0;Leif^c:pop; asked me to come help him in the shop once I'm moved in!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001800=I guess I also have some items I should return to him first...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80001900=So what do you think ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, will you help me build my house?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002000=Thanks ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002100=I would gladly do it by myself! but I would be better off keeping my creativity to games...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002200=Wouldn't want my house to collapse on me after all, haha.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002300=You can also grab my toys and all that extra toilet paper from my island too!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002400=Wow, it looks great! It's almost as good as I had imagined!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002500=Now all I need to do is set my computer up...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002600=Let's play together again soon!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002700=Hey... ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002800=Do you know everyone in this town?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80002900=What am I saying... of course you do.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003000=So uh, you know ^c:1486b0;Rosemary^c:pop;?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003100=She seems very kind.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003200=But I'm not sure how to approach her.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003300=I was thinking... What if I could get her a new pet?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003400=Maybe something for the ^c:1486b0;Pet Store^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003500=Or maybe just for her...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003600=You know... I think I saw this really cute ^c:1486b0;Fox^c:pop; on ^c:1486b0;Galaxy Island^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003700=You don't know what the ^c:1486b0;Galaxy Island^c:pop; is? It's the island that we met on.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003800=Maybe you could make friends with that ^c:1486b0;Fox^c:pop;... While I try to figure out what to say.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80003900=It had this ^c:d03e37;light brown fur^c:pop; with a dark tip at the tail, I'm sure you'll recognise it.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004000=^c:1486b0;Foxes^c:pop; generally aren't picky with their food...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004100=But I've heard that the ^c:d03e37;Moon Fish^c:pop; on that island are their favourite.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004200=So please...  can you get that ^c:1486b0;Fox^c:pop; for me?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004300=Yes! That's the one. I'll just take that it off you, thanks!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004400=I know how to deal with ^c:1486b0;foxes^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004500=Looks like it needs a little grooming... and a name...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004600=I will take good care of it for now though.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004700=I just need to talk with ^c:1486b0;Rosemary^c:pop;...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004800=I can do this...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80004900=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;... Thank you for the help you've given me.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005000=^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005100=It didn't go well...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005200=I brought ^c:1486b0;Cinnamon^c:pop; to ^c:1486b0;Rosemary^c:pop;, but it scared ^c:1486b0;Poopsy^c:pop; and ^c:1486b0;Hazel^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005300=They ran off immediately and ^c:1486b0;Rosemary^c:pop; had to go find them...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005400=I expected ^c:1486b0;Cinnamon^c:pop; to behave a little better.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005500=Oh! Back on the island, I was playing the ^c:d03e37;Flute^c:pop; when I first approached the foxes.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005600=They were calm then... and they were always nice to me after that.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005700=Especially ^c:1486b0;Cinnamon^c:pop;...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005800=I hope ^c:1486b0;Rosemary^c:pop; still wants to be my friend...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80005900=Where can we find this flute?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006000=Can we make a new flute?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006100=I'm not sure where I left the flute...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006200=But I do remember how I made it!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006300=If you could do this for me, I... I'll build you a mansion!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006400=Not a real one of course...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006500=Thanks for helping me out ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006700=The flute requires some ^c:d03e37;Purple Nettle^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006710=I don't think I saw any growing on ^c:1486b0;Galaxy Island^c:pop; still, but I'm sure ^c:1486b0;Rem^c:pop; has some seeds in her store.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006600=We just need to get that flute...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006700=I believe that you'll need to collect some plants from the ^c:1486b0;Galaxy Island^c:pop;...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006800=I'm nervous just thinking of how to make up with ^c:1486b0;Rosemary^c:pop;...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80006900=Amazing, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007000=I will have to practice... but I think I can do it.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007100=You're the best friend I've ever had, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007200=Now to make up with Rosemary...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007300=Maybe I should tell her about the other animals...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007400=Hey ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;, something interesting happened!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007500=The other day I was building a house, and another person actually joined me!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007600=In the game of course, I wasn't building around here...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007700=I think his name is ^c:1486b0;Jamie^c:pop;?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007800=He may be another friend! I just need to figure out who he is...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80007900=Actually, isn't there someone called ^c:1486b0;Jamie^c:pop; that lives here?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008000=I think I saw him about the village... Playing games on his phone...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008100=But I haven't spoken to him too much...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008200=Anyway, I've actually been thinking, now that I have a real house...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008300=I want to have a LAN party!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008400=But... My house is suited for that at all!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008500=Could I get you to make some improvements to my house?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008600=You did such a good job building it! But it just needs a little extra!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008610=^c:1486b0;Rem^c:pop; mentioned recently she found my old ^c:d03e37;Gaming Desktop^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008620=Go see her when she's around with her shop, she might have it for sale.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008700=I promise, it will be the last thing I ask of you!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008800=Wow, you're the best!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80008900=Now we need to actually get prepared for the party...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009000=Perfect! Maybe I should have asked for more cheesecake, this looks good.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009100=I am so looking forward to this.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009200=Thank you for everything, ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009300=I couldn't be happier right now. None of my other friends are like you!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009400=Actually... you know what would be fun?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009500=If we became roomies!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009600=Now that I've got two computers, we could play games together all the time!.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009700=Well, even if you don’t want to, I'd love it if you at least come over every now and then.
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009800=I'll show you how to build the best house ever!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80009900=In that game of course...
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80010000=See you around ^c:1486b0;{0-playername}^c:pop;. Thank you!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80010100=All we need now is some food and drinks and it will be great!
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80010200=Could you get us a ^c:d03e37;Cheesecake^c:pop;, 2 ^c:d03e37;Hot Cocoa^c:pop; and maybe 2 ^c:d03e37;Nettle Soup^c:pop;?
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80010300=You might need to gather some ingredients from the ^c:1486b0;Galaxy Island^c:pop;
staxel.collector.village.character.dialogue.CollectorGuy.line:80010400=Could you also let ^c:1486b0;Jamie^c:pop; know for me?
